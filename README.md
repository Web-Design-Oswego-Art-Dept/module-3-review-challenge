# Module 3 Review Challenge
This challenge will reinforce the knowledge you gained from Module 3.

In this challenge you'll need to edit these files to style the given images appropriately for the web. This includes:
- Linking images properly
- Constraining images to their container
- Changing layout using a media query
- Controlling horizontal spacing issues

## Tasks
- Start by looking at the images in the screenshots folder to familiarize yourself with where you are headed in this challenge. 
  - The screenshots are named based on the viewport width (in rems).
  - There are two screenshots for each viewport width so you can preview the entire page's contents.
- Fix the following issues
  - The images aren't showing up when previewing in the browser!
    - Once you've gotten the images to show up, make sure they are constrained to the container (do this in the css).
    - Add spacing between the image/caption combo and the text that wrap around it (see screenshots for reference).
  - The code is not valid!
  - The image/caption combos should be 50% of the screen width when larger than 74rem, not 75% like they are now.
- Make the site live.

## Submit on Blackboard
- URL to live website
- Screenshots demonstrating that the *live* HTML and CSS are both valid
