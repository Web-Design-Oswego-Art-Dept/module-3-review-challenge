# Module 3 Review Challenge
This challenge will test your knowledge of the content from Module 3.

In this challenge you'll need to edit these files to style the given images appropriately for the web. You will:
- Constrain images to their container
- Use the picture element to "art direct" the images used across screen sizes
- Practice using float as a layout technique
- Change layout using a media query

## Tasks
- Start by looking at the images in the screenshots folder to familiarize yourself with where you are headed in this challenge. 
  - The screenshots are named based on the viewport width (in rems).
  - There are two screenshots for each viewport width so you can preview the entire page's contents.

- Fix the source element typos to correctly display each image.

- Use the square image for screens less than 480px wide (be sure to use the rem value).

- Add alt text to each image.

- Constrain the images to their container (do this as a "default" in the CSS).

- Make the figure caption text size match the paragraph text size when the screen is 74rem or larger.

- Make the appropriate changes in the CSS so that the following statements are true:
  - Each image/caption combo takes up **50% of the article width** when the screen is 74rem or larger.
  - The **first image/caption combo is aligned to the left** and the text wraps around the right-hand side.
  - The **second image/caption combo is aligned to the right** and the text wraps around the left-hand side.

- Add spacing between the image/caption combo and the text wrap (see screenshots for reference).

- Make the site live.

## Submit on Blackboard
- URL to live website
- Screenshots demonstrating that the HTML and CSS are both valid
